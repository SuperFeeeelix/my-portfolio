My Portfolio

## General Information
Website name Felix Portfolio by Oswaldo Felix is a portfolio to show employers what I can do in terms of using Frontend developing skills in HTML and CSS. as opening the page you will find that the .container class in the CSS places and image for the background of a symbol and says "Trusted Society" which is my upcoming project of a small clothing brand business. sized the image to fit a 1/3 of the page by sizing it with the width and the height in CSS. While being new to coding had difficulties placing the image into the page due to css not finding the file from my page that took me 3 hours to figure out by watching nultiple youtube videos and reading sites. The portfolio in the left top side is to show the viewer that this is my current position
